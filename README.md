# MTG Scryings

*In the darkest libraries of Tolaria, a twisted mage quest the palantir for stories of Dominian magic. The visions create rifts in time and space, revealing empires of the past and future, planes long forgotten, and the Dominian Ice Age alongside the lush landscapes of Jamuraa a millennia later. A wanderlust to this reality can only be quenched by **Scryings**.*

**Release date:** December 28th 2019
**Set size:** 116 (40 common, 35 uncommon, 41 rare)
**Origins:**
* Fallen Empires
* Ice Age
* Homelands
* Alliances
* Mirage
* Visions
* Weatherlight

**Legality:** Occasional and at organizers' discretion; e.g. at n00bcon 12

The expansions from the tail end of 1994 up to the middle of 1997 have a certain silver-age feel. And they bring cards that would be sweet to re-evaluate with our contemporary understanding of Magic. But even disregarding any blatant anachronisms, legalizing any given of those sets could also come with some baggage. There's a lot of spice in Alliances, but is giving control decks access to Force of Will worth it?

So an "old school Future Sight" or "reversed Chronicles" seemed like the most interesting approach. Eagle-eyed statisticians may recognize the set size of 116 cards as a subtle wink to just Chronicles. For those of you eager to discern more on what Scryings will contain, here's a few of the constraints I used when selecting the cards:
Each color will have the same number of cards, distributed at the same rarity. 
Rarity in Scryings is the same as the rarity of the cards in the original set.
The focus should not be to make existing tier1 decks better, but rather to fill holes in mid-tier strategies or create new ones.
To maintain a somewhat uniform style within the set, 
* No cards with the old tap symbol will be included.
* No new keywords will be introduced in the set.

We don't want to release cards that are "obvious restrictions", but rather encourage exploration. That said, a card having been banned or restricted in its heyday could still be fair game today.
Cards that create a lot of consistency could alter the old school "rythm", so we should tread careful with cantrips, tutors and the likes.
